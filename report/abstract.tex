\chapter*{Abstract}
\noindent

Mobile devices with cameras now contain various photos ranging from natural
scenery and city skylines, to street signs and restaurant menus.
When deciding to review these various moments in daily life, one can opt to use
a wallpaper application which sets an image from the photo collection as a
wallpaper.
Unfortunately, not all photos are suitable nor well composed.
This study is a novel attempt to improve these aspects.
This is done by first deciding if an image is suitable to be used as a wallpaper,
and if so how it should be cropped and shown on a given display.
The selection algorithm yields a classification error as low as 3.7\% where images with annotations in agreement are evaluated.
The cropping algorithm is based on work by Fang et al. and yields an improved 0.782 median maximum overlap score, a $\sim6\%$ improvement.
Qualitative results are quite good where photos with less desirable objects are
omitted, and more interesting regions are retained in the final crops.
