> Compare resulting crop with crops displayed in Chen paper

|> Add more data to trainer?
|  - Could use EarthPorn as good crop
|    and random crops of EarthPorn as bad crop
|
| DONE

|> Split data into training/testing 2:1
|
| DONE

|> Quantitative validation (majority vote)
|  - % of correct classifications
|
| Waiting on Dengxin. Min selection works quite well

|> Try to recreate plot from paper
|
| DONE

|> MMR: Maximal Marginal Relevance, greedy selection to diversify
|
| DONE

> Look into personal-bias (who classifies the dataset)

|> Complete pipeline by joining autocrop+suitability
|
| DONE

|> Blurriness feature
|  - Maybe use Python library for calling matlab code
|
| Stopped: Matlab code much too slow and too many issues including
|          reference code not working.

|> See how our classifications correlate
|  - If high correlation, good for general purpose
|
| DONE
