Done:
- Upper bound on quantitative error
- Basic classifier for wallpaper suitability using fc6

Todo:
- Look into blurriness feature
- Read convolutional networks material
- Cross-validation in training

Michael:
- Split data into training/testing 2:1
- Quantitative validation (majority vote)
  - % of correct classifications
- Try to recreate plot from paper
- MMR: Maximal Marginal Relevance, greedy selection to diversify
- Look into personal-bias (who classifies the dataset)

Dengxin:
- Complete pipeline by joining autocrop+suitability
- Blurriness feature
  - Maybe use Python library for calling matlab code
- See how our classifications correlate
  - If high correlation, good for general purpose

Admin
- Presentation maybe 25th
- Report due before end (26th)
  - There is format
