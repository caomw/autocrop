Proposed titles
===============
- Image retargeting for specified aspect ratios
- Image retargeting hints for landscape scenes
- Image retargeting on screens of mobile devices

Keywords
========
- Image cropping
- Image retargeting
- Cropping hints
  - One target goal could be a service which provides hints on how to crop
    [depending on content distribution (symm/faces/geom)]
- Artifact-free
  - No seam carving, removal of content, skew/scaling of objects

Todos
=====
- Pick image retargeting algorithm
  - Chen Fang. Boundary simplicity and content preservation.

- Pick performance metrics
  - Earth-Mover's Distance (EMD)
  - SIFT-flow

- Initial implementation on PC with OpenCV
- Initial implementation on Muzei


Problems
========
- Evaluation
  - Use existing training datasets
  - Anything better?
    - Can hire students for studies?
    - Online data collection?
      - Can create a website with suggested cropping and let people drag better crop
    - Image copyrights?
      [M] Flickr is usually ok. Can also choose similar images.
      [D] If used in app in future, can have problem
    [D] CVPR paper provides images as well

[M] Start with initial simple idea then think about own dataset.
    Not a problem to get 1-200 images.

[D] Could use prof. photographer images as "already cropped"
    Two datasets: Good/Bad by pros/people.
    [M] Flickr, lot of likes against average image


Dengxin's Idea
==============
In image resizing, there are multiple operations possible.
Intelligently select crop/resize/multiop


Michael's Suggestion
====================
1. Intelligently select photos from phone gallery.
2. Given image source, diversify backgrounds. (Always vary)


Logistics
=========
[M] Just e-mail all the time, then organise time.
    Could work in the student room.
    Organise weekly meeting slots after administrative work is done.


TODO
====
Write a draft of project proposal.
- Title + few sentences.

[M] Project is two parts: reimplement algo, port to phone
    Second is improving algorithms more.
