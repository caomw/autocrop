M&D: Resize image to avoid long processing times.

M: Should really try boolean saliency map, especially if code exists
   - Saliency detection: A boolean map approach

D: Might be interesting to see how some information can be lost due to image
   resizing before processing.


Comments
--------
Try not to get side-tracked, generating saliency maps is not the prime goal of
this project.

Make use of existing code and see how they work to save time.

M: Can organise second weekly meeting. Just ask.


Carried on from previous weeks
