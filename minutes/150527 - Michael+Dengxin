Dengxin: Get upper bound on overlap by looking at all crop candidates
- Generate crop candidates
- Get maximum overlap over all candidates
- If this is not 0.9 or so, then can look into previous steps
  - Identify where the issue might be
- Try thicker gradient borders

Michael: Try parameters/setup from last week. Those looked good.
- Original 2-level spatial pyramid
- Blurring in saliency map is good to pad objects
- C range usually [1e-5, 1e5]
