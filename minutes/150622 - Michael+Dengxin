Autocrop
========
- Try moving boundary simplicity into training stage
  - Removes simple weighting which might be wrong
  - Can try putting each edge as a feature (top, left, bottom, right)
    - Top simplicity may be more important than bottom simplicity

- Try to center final crop

- Training should be faster...


Suitability
===========
- Just use Caffe reference ImageNet model. Don't complicate things.

- Only count errors for cases where classifications agree

- Show images with highest possibility of being suitable
  - Visually show in descending order which images are better as wallpapers
