Auto-cropping
-------------

Pipeline works
Need quantitative evaluation - saliency overlap, see paper

Need to improve trainer
Currently using C-SVC with linear kernel.
	How to best validate?
	Shouldn't CV take care of this?

Use edges to decide if image is too cluttered?
See: Snap point detection paper

Later: try another SPSM level (8x8)


Wallpaper Suitability
---------------------

Got classification script done
	Works on all of our machines?
	How to combine data? What kind of ML?
		SVM? But multiple classes per feature vector
			Average
			Majority voting
			Discard
			Other weighting
			Trust SVM + CV

Classification for case where cropped image may be suitable
- Classify good if good crop is 80% of image size or more

Get rotation data from EXIF
- Apply to script and further code

Read Michael's code and try it out
- Feature vector
  - No. of object classes

Maybe focus on generating features:
	Blur
	Edges (clutter)
	Face Detection


Next Meeting: Wednesday 11.00
